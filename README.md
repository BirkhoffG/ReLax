<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Key Features

- **fast**: code runs significantly faster than existing CF explanation
  libraries.
- **scalable**: code can be accelerated over *CPU*, *GPU*, and *TPU*
- **flexible**: we provide flexible API for researchers to allow full
  customization.

TODO: - implement various methods of CF explanations

## Install

`cfnet` is built on top of
[Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). It also uses
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) to load data.

### Running on CPU

If you only need to run `cfnet` on CPU, you can simply install via `pip`
or clone the `GitHub` project.

Installation via PyPI:

``` bash
pip install cfnet
```

Editable Install:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/BirkhoffG/cfnet.git
pip install -e cfnet
```

### Running on GPU or TPU

If you wish to run `cfnet` on GPU or TPU, please first install this
library via `pip install cfnet`.

Then, you should install the right GPU or TPU version of Jax by
following steps in the [install
guidelines](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

## An Example of using `cfnet`

See [How to use cfnet](tutorials/how_to_use_cfnet.ipynb).
