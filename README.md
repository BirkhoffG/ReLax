`ReLax` (**Re**course Explanation **L**ibrary in J**ax**) is a library
built on top of `jax` to generate counterfactual and recourse
explanations. By leveraging *vectorization* though `vmap`/`pmap` and
*just-in-time* compilation in `jax`, `ReLax` offers massive speed
improvements in generating individual (or local) explanations.

Some of the key features:

- **Fast** recourse generation via `jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`/`jax.pmap`.

- **Accelerated** over *CPU*, *GPU*, and *TPU*.

- **Extensive** recourse methods implemented for benchmarking.

- **Customizable** API to enable building entire modeling and
  interpreting pipeline.

## Installation

The latest `ReLax` release can directly be installed from PyPI:

``` bash
pip install jax-relax
```

or install directly from the repository:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/BirkhoffG/cfnet.git
```

To fully leverage accelerators (e.g., GPU, PU), please follow steps in
the [Jax installation
guidelines](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).
