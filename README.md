`ReLax` (**Re**course Explanation **L**ibrary in J**ax**) is a library
built on top of `jax` to generate counterfactual and recourse
explanations. By leveraging *vectorization* though `vmap`/`pmap` and
*just-in-time* compilation in `jax`, `ReLax` offers massive speed
improvements in generating individual (or local) explanations.

Some of the key features:

- **Fast** recourse generation via `jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`/`jax.pmap`.

- **Accelerated** over *CPU*, *GPU*, and *TPU*.

- **Extensive** recourse methods implemented for benchmarking.

- **Customizable** API to enable building entire modeling and
  interpreting pipeline.

## Install

`RELax` is built on top of
[Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The latest `RELax` release can directly be installed from PyPI:

If you only need to run `RELax` on CPU, you can simply install via `pip`
or clone the `GitHub` project.

Installation via PyPI:

``` bash
pip install jax-relax
```

or install directly from the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/BirkhoffG/ReLax.git
pip install -e .
```

### Running on GPU or TPU

If you wish to run `RELax` on GPU or TPU, please first install this
library via `pip install jax-relax`.

Then, you should install the right GPU or TPU version of Jax by
following steps in the [install
guidelines](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).
