## Overview

`ReLax` (**Re**course Explanation **L**ibrary in J**ax**) is a library
built on top of `jax` to generate counterfactual and recourse
explanations for Machine Learning algorithms. By leveraging
*vectorization* though `vmap`/`pmap` and *just-in-time* compilation in
[jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (a high-performance
auto-differentiation library). `ReLax` offers massive speed improvements
in generating individual (or local) explanations for predictions made by
Machine Learning algorithms.

Some of the key features are as follows:

- üèÉ **Fast** recourse generation via `jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`/`jax.pmap`.

- üöÄ **Accelerated** over `cpu`, `gpu`, `tpu`.

- ü™ì **Comprehensive** set of recourse methods implemented for
  benchmarking.

- üëê **Customizable** API to enable the building of entire modeling

- and interpretation pipelines for new recourse algorithms.

## Installation

The latest `ReLax` release can directly be installed from PyPI:

``` bash
pip install jax-relax
```

or installed directly from the repository:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/BirkhoffG/ReLax.git 
```

To futher unleash the power of accelerators (i.e., GPU/TPU), we suggest
to first install this library via `pip install jax-relax`. Then, follow
steps in the [official install
guidelines](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) to install the
right version for GPU or TPU.

## An Example of using `ReLax`

See [Getting Started with
ReLax](https://birkhoffg.github.io/ReLax/tutorials/getting_started.html).
