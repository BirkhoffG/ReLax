    "`ReLax` (**Re**course Explanation **L**ibrary in J**ax**) is a library built on top of `jax` \n",
    "to generate counterfactual and recourse explanations for Machine Learning algorithms. \n",
    "By leveraging *vectorization* though `vmap`/`pmap` and *just-in-time* compilation in \n",
    "[jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (a high-performance auto-differentiation library).\n",
    "`ReLax` offers massive speed improvements in generating individual (or local) explanations\n",
    "for predictions made by Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key features are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* üèÉ **Fast** recourse generation via `jax.jit`, `jax.vmap`/`jax.pmap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* üöÄ **Accelerated** over `cpu`, `gpu`, `tpu`.\n",

    "\n",
    "* üëê **Customizable** API to enable the building of entire modeling \n",
